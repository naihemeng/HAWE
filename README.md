Representation Learning on Heterostructures via Heterogeneous Anonymous Walks

* First of all, we must apologize for a major mistake. Due to a fault in the early code for data process, the Stack Exchange networks were at first wrongly constructed. Though we had fixed the fault in our later implementation, the table of dataset statistics in the previous manuscript has not been corrected. After repeated inspection, we confirm that the experimental results in the last manuscript were not affected by this mistake. In the final version of the paper, we give the correct dataset statistics.
